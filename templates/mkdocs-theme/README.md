# Shared MkDocs theme

This folder is the canonical source for the five ecosystem documentation sites. `scripts/sync_mkdocs_theme.py` copies its generated files into a consuming repository and checks that committed copies are byte-identical.

## Generated files

| Source | Consumer path |
| --- | --- |
| `extra.css` | `<content-source>/stylesheets/extra.css` |
| `overrides/main.html` | `.config/mkdocs-overrides/main.html` (the theme's `custom_dir`, kept out of the repository root) |
| `assets/*` | `<content-source>/assets/*` |
| `glossary.md` | `<content-source>/glossary.md` |
| `base.mkdocs.yml` | inherited directly from the pinned pipelines checkout |

`<content-source>` is the explicitly declared `docs` or `pages` directory. Run `python scripts/sync_mkdocs_theme.py sync --root REPOSITORY --content-source docs` to update files, and the same command with `check` to verify exact equality without writing. The Pages workflow checks the committed assets against its immutable workflow checkout before building.

## MkDocs configuration

The repository's `mkdocs.yml` inherits `templates/mkdocs-theme/base.mkdocs.yml` and supplies `extra.ecosystem.current` with its own slug (`agent-webui`, `graph-os`, `agent-utilities`, `epistemic-graph`, or `agent-connector-sdk`). It continues to own its site name, URL, content directory, and navigation. For local builds, check out the exact pinned `pipelines` revision into `.pipeline-theme`, run the `sync` command above, then run `mkdocs build --strict`.

Use `.site-hero`, `.site-card-grid` / `.site-card`, `.site-ownership__grid` / `.site-ownership__item`, and the ordered `.site-flow` components for landing-page structure. Prefer semantic HTML and retain visible keyboard focus. The common theme uses native `<details>` for the site switcher and does not require custom JavaScript.

The root `README.md` remains the short entry point and keeps its exact ordered headings: Overview, Key capabilities, Documentation, Architecture, Quick start, Contributing, License. Deep reference material belongs in Pages. Public home pages describe the current bundled ecosystem in present tense; they do not contain planning, migration, worktree, or future-release status.
